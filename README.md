ðŸ“¡ FreePBX NWS SAME Alert System

This project integrates the National Weather Service (NWS) Alerts API with FreePBX to automatically deliver voice alerts via paging/intercom to selected extensions.

Users can dial into a special menu, subscribe to their SAME (FIPS) codes, and automatically receive text-to-speech (TTS) alerts when warnings are issued for their area.

âœ¨ Features

User Menu (extension 7788)

Press 1 â†’ Add a SAME code

Press 2 â†’ Remove a SAME code

Press 3 â†’ List current codes

Automatic Paging

Polls the NWS API for active alerts

Generates high-quality audio using local TTS

Auto-answers phones via the FreePBX intercom prefix (*80)

De-duplication

Each extension receives each alert only once, even if it covers multiple SAME codes

Easy Testing

Manual script provided to send test TTS messages to any extension

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

same_subs.py
Handles subscription logic (add/remove/list SAME codes).

extensions_custom.conf
Custom FreePBX dialplan additions (binds extension 7788 to the menu).

generatePrompts.sh
Helper script to generate the audio prompts used by the subscription menu.

nws_alert_poller.py
Polls the NWS API, generates alert audio, and originates paging calls.

nws-alert-poller.service
A systemd service unit file to keep the poller running continuously.

ðŸš€ Installation

Dependencies
Install required tools:

apt-get update
apt-get install -y libttspico-utils sox


Deploy files
Copy each file from this repo to its destination:

same_subs.py â†’ /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/

extensions_custom.conf â†’ /etc/asterisk/

generatePrompts.sh â†’ Anywhere convenient (e.g. /usr/local/bin/)

nws_alert_poller.py â†’ /usr/local/bin/

nws-alert-poller.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/

Make scripts executable:

chmod +x /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/same_subs.py
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nws_alert_poller.py
chmod +x generatePrompts.sh


Generate prompts
Run:

./generatePrompts.sh


This will create the menu audio files inside FreePBXâ€™s sounds directory.

Reload FreePBX

fwconsole reload


Enable the poller service
Update the systemd service file (nws-alert-poller.service) with your email address in the NWS_USER_AGENT environment variable (e.g., replace you@domain.com).
Then run:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now nws-alert-poller

ðŸ§ª Testing

Dial 7788 from any extension to subscribe to a SAME code.

Check logs for the poller:

journalctl -xeu nws-alert-poller --no-pager


To force a test message, use the manual paging script (not in repo, but included in instructions):

./nws_tts_page.sh -e 1001 -m "This is a test of the paging system."

ðŸ”§ Customization

Email Address
Update nws-alert-poller.service and replace you@domain.com with your actual contact email.
NWS requires a valid User-Agent string when hitting their API.

Extension Numbers
Adjust the intercom prefix (*80) or the subscription menu extension (7788) in extensions_custom.conf if needed.

Codecs
Enable G.722 (wideband) on your phones and in FreePBX for higher-quality audio.

ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

No audio or garbled prompts?
Ensure libttspico-utils and sox are installed.

No alerts arriving?
Check /etc/asterisk/nws_subscriptions.json â€” subscriptions must exist.

Phones not auto-answering?
Confirm *80 intercom prefix is enabled in FreePBX and phones are set to trust intercom auto-answer.

ðŸ“§ Notes

This project is a starting point â€” itâ€™s up to you to maintain and secure your FreePBX server.

Always replace placeholders like you@domain.com with real, valid details.

Alerts are issued immediately by the NWS API, but actual delivery depends on poller frequency and phone configuration.

âœ¨ Thatâ€™s it! Once installed, your FreePBX will call subscribed extensions with live NWS weather alerts.
